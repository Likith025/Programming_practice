# Stage 1: Fundamentals of C and Firmware Development

This stage focuses on building strong fundamentals in C programming and getting comfortable with embedded concepts before diving into STM32 firmware development.

---

## 🎯 Goals of Stage 1

- Build solid foundations in C programming (specific to embedded systems)
- Understand how to organize and track code using GitHub

---

## 📚 Task List (In Order)

### ✅ C Programming Practice (for Embedded)
- [ ] Pointers (single, double, function args)
- [ ] Arrays & Strings (2D arrays, string manipulation)
- [ ] Bitwise Operations (masks, shifting)
- [ ] Structures & Unions
- [ ] Enums and Typedefs
- [ ] Memory Layout: Stack vs Heap (conceptual)
- [ ] Function Pointers and Callbacks
- [ ] Writing modular code with `main.c`, `utils.c`, `utils.h`

### ✅ Git & GitHub Basics
- [ ] Create personal learning repo on GitHub
- [ ] Set up local git and practice push/pull/commit
- [ ] Document every learning module with commit messages and small READMEs

---

## 📝 Optional Tools to Explore
- [ ] VS Code + C/C++ Extension for coding
- [ ] GitHub Desktop (if you're not using CLI yet)
- [ ] Markdown for writing notes (`README.md`)

---

## 📌 Tips
- Track your daily or weekly progress in `Progress_Logs/`
- Keep your code clean, modular, and well-commented
- Revisit tough concepts — repetition builds mastery!
